HTTP Live Stream (HLS) Transcriber Sample
=========================================

This sample demonstrates how to transcribe/live-subtitle
[HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming) media.
The project is developed for .NET Framework 4.7.1, but should be compatible with versions >= 4.6.
The audio extraction and format detection is implemented using
[NAudio library](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio). The transciption is done with
[Bing Speech API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech/).

## Getting started ##

1. Open the [HLSSample.sln](/HLSSample.sln) solution file with Visual Studio
2. Select the start-up project (`HSLConsoleTest.NETFramework` or `HSLWPFTest.NETFramework`):
   Right-click the project name in **Solution Explorer** and select **Set as StartUp Project**
3. Insert the **playlist URL** (`.m3u8` file) as the value of `PlaylistUrl` string constant:
    * To [Program.cs file](/HLSConsoleTest.NETFramework/Program.cs#L11) in the console app 
    * To [MainWindow.xaml.cs file](/HLSWPFTest.NETFramework/MainWindow.xaml.cs#L17) in the WPF app
4. Insert the **Bing Speech API** subscription key to enable transcription (can be omitted but so will then be the transcription)
5. Run and enjoy

## Implementation ##

The solution consists of three projects:
1. [HSTools.NETFramework](/HLSTools.NETFramework),
2. [HSLConsoleTest.NETFramework](/HLSConsoleTest.NETFramework) and
3. [HSLWPFTest.NETFramework](/HLSWPFTest.NETFramework).

**HSLTools.NETFramework** is a class library project containing the main functionality whilst the
two other (demo apps) serve as examples on how to use the aforementioned library.

### HSLTools ###

The **HSLTools** class library implements the following features:
* Loading and parsing HTTP Live Stream playlists (`.m3u8` files)
* Downloading `.ts` files into memory
* Extracting audio from `.ts` files utilizing [NAudio library](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio)
* Saving binary files on local disk
* Transcribing audio (bytes) with [Bing Speech API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech/)

The main class of the library is [HLSProcessor](/HLSTools.NETFramework/HLSProcessor.cs).
See the two demo application projects (HLSConsoleTest and HLSWPFTest) to learn how to use the class
library.

### HLSConsoleTest and HLSWPFTest projects ###

**HLSConsoleTest** processes the given playlist and displays the audio transcription in the
console window. **HLSWPFTest** plays and displays the video files in the playlist with
subtitles, which are produced by transcribing the audio in the media.

## What's missing? ##

This is not a production-ready piece of code, but rather a proof-of-concept.
Stuff missing/to consider:
* Universal Windows applications are not supported - please support/contribute to the awesome
  [NAudio project](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio) in order to enable UWP compatibility.
* The media chunks are processed as they come (via the playlist). Thus, if/when the audio in
  the chunk is terminated in the middle of a word, the transcription is incomplete
  * "TODO" item here: Refactor/break the chunks in pieces based on the silent bits in the audio
* The [MediaElement](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.mediaelement(v=vs.110).aspx)
  in WPF applications does not support HTTP Live Stream out-of-the-box - the quick and dirty
  approach taken here is to save the `.ts` files onto local disk and to feed the `MediaElement` the
  local URIs.
